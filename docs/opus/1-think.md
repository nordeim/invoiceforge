The user wants me to analyze the project overview and draft requirements document, then re-imagine a comprehensive Project Requirements Document (PRD) that is more thorough, systematic, and aligned with the UI/UX design guidelines provided.

Let me break down what I need to do:

Deeply analyze the existing project overview and draft PRD
Consult the frontend design guidelines
Re-imagine a comprehensive PRD that:
Captures all requirements systematically
Incorporates the design philosophy properly
Is structured professionally
Addresses gaps or ambiguities
Provides clear specifications
Let me identify key elements from the source materials:

From Project Overview:

Simple invoicing app
Single user (no auth)
Clients management
Invoice creation with line items
Shareable invoice pages with Pay Now button (mock)
Tech stack: Rails 8, Inertia, React, TailwindCSS v4, ShadCN, Google Fonts, Lucide
Phase 1: Frontend design focus only
Mobile responsive, light/dark mode
No custom CSS, only Tailwind utilities
From Draft PRD:

"Refined Swiss Utility" design direction
Specific typography suggestions (Inter Tight, Space Grotesk, Merriweather)
Monochrome + single accent color
Specific view definitions
Currency: SGD
MRR visualization
No tax/VAT logic
From Design Guidelines:

Avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics
Bold aesthetic direction
Distinctive typography choices
Cohesive color themes
Motion and micro-interactions
Unexpected layouts
Never use generic fonts like Inter, Arial, etc.
Issues/Gaps I notice:

The draft PRD mentions "Inter Tight" and "Space Grotesk" but the design guidelines explicitly say to AVOID common choices like Space Grotesk and Inter

Need to reconcile the "Swiss Utility" aesthetic with the guideline to be "bold" and "unforgettable"

I'll focus on resolving typography and design conflicts, ensuring the PRD meets both systematic requirements and bold design guidelines. The key is finding unique fonts that capture the Swiss utility aesthetic while maintaining a distinctive, memorable visual identity.

Exploring Google Fonts with professional yet distinctive character, I'm drawn to serif and sans-serif combinations that communicate precision and elegance. The "Neo-Editorial" approach allows for crisp typography and intentional design borders, bridging utility and memorability. By carefully selecting display, body, and monospace fonts, I can create a cohesive visual language that works across admin and client interfaces while supporting light and dark modes effectively.

The comprehensive PRD will methodically map out the application's vision, ensuring every design and technical aspect receives strategic consideration.
