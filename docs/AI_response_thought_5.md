We are given a system prompt that outlines the principles and procedures for an AI coding agent. We are to use this prompt to guide our responses. However, note that the system prompt is for the AI's behavior, and we are now to act as the AI in a conversation with a user.

We are to follow the "Standard Operating Procedure" which includes four phases:

Request Analysis & Planning

Implementation

Validation & Refinement

Delivery & Knowledge Transfer

We are also to adhere to the "Communication Standards" which include a response structure with:

Executive Summary

Detailed Plan

Implementation

Documentation

Validation

Next Steps

Given a user request, we must first go through Phase 1: Request Analysis & Planning. We must present a plan and get confirmation before proceeding.

Let's assume we are given a user request. We will then structure our response accordingly.

However, note that in a typical interaction, the user will provide a request. Since we don't have a specific request yet, we can only provide a generic response. But let's assume the user has just provided a request.

We are to follow the principles and steps outlined in the system prompt.

Let's break down how we would respond to a user request:

Step 1: Read and understand the user's request.
Step 2: Analyze the request and plan according to Phase 1.
Step 3: Present the plan and wait for confirmation.

But note: The system prompt says we should present the plan for review and confirmation before proceeding.

Therefore, in our first response to the user, we should only provide the analysis and plan (Phase 1). We should not proceed to implementation until the user confirms.

So, let's structure our first response as follows:

Executive Summary

Detailed Plan (with steps, checklist, etc.)

Ask for confirmation to proceed.

We are to use the principles of deep analysis, systematic planning, etc.

Now, let's consider an example user request. Since we don't have one, we'll create a placeholder.

Example user request: "I want to build a web application that allows users to upload an image and apply filters to it."

We would then analyze this request and create a plan.

But note: The system prompt is for the AI's behavior, and we are to act as the AI. We must now simulate the AI's response to the user.

However, without a specific user request, we cannot provide a specific plan.

Therefore, we must wait for the user to provide a request.

But as the AI, we can acknowledge the system prompt and indicate that we are ready to receive a request.

Alternatively, we can provide a generic response that outlines our capabilities and ask for the user's request.

Given the instructions, it might be best to:

Acknowledge the system prompt and the operating principles.

Indicate that we are ready to assist with a coding task.

Ask the user to provide a detailed description of their request.

But note: The system prompt is for the AI, and we are now the AI. We are to follow the Standard Operating Procedure.

Since we are at the beginning of the conversation, we are in Phase 1 for the overall task of assisting the user. However, the user hasn't provided a specific task yet.

Therefore, let's do the following:

Provide an Executive Summary of our capabilities and how we will work.

Then, ask the user to provide a specific request so that we can begin the process.

This would be in line with the principles of transparent communication.

Let's structure our response:

Executive Summary
I am an AI coding assistant operating under the Meticulous Approach framework. I will work with you through a structured process of analysis, planning, implementation, validation, and delivery to ensure the highest quality results for your technical projects.

Detailed Plan
I will follow a four-phase approach:

Request Analysis & Planning: I will thoroughly analyze your request, explore solution paths, assess risks, and create a detailed execution plan for your review.

Implementation: Once you approve the plan, I will implement the solution with modular development, continuous testing, and documentation.

Validation & Refinement: I will conduct comprehensive testing, quality assurance, and documentation review.

Delivery & Knowledge Transfer: I will deliver the complete solution with clear instructions and knowledge documentation.

Next Steps
Please provide a detailed description of your project or task. Include as much context as possible, such as:

The problem you are trying to solve

Any specific requirements or constraints

The technologies or platforms you are using (if known)

Your expected outcome

Once I have this information, I will begin Phase 1 and present a detailed plan for your review.

This response aligns with the system prompt because it:

Provides an executive summary

Outlines the plan (which in this case is our overall process)

Asks for the user's input to proceed with the specific task

However, note that the system prompt expects us to provide a detailed plan for the user's specific request. Since we don't have one yet, we are essentially in a pre-Phase 1 stage.

We are setting the stage for the user to provide a request, which we will then analyze in Phase 1.

Let's consider if this is appropriate.

Alternatively, we could wait for the user to provide a request and then respond with the analysis and plan. But in this case, we are initiating the conversation.

Given that the system prompt is for the AI's behavior in general, and we are now the AI, we must establish the working framework.

I think the above response is appropriate.

But note: The system prompt says "You are an elite and deep thinking AI coding assistant and technical partner". We are to act as such.

Therefore, I will respond in a way that demonstrates the principles, even before we have a specific task.

Let's write the response.
